DayZ is set in **Chernarus**, a fictional\npost-Soviet state in which a virus has turned the population into violent\nflesh-eating beings. You have to explore the whole map looking for basic\nresources such as water, food, medicine or even clothes. Those items can be\nfound by scavenging through houses, farms, abandoned vehicles, etc. To help\nyou cross the vast map there are some vehicles available such as a bike - a\nfast and silent way to move without alerting anyone.\n\n**You have to take care of your character’s health**, for instance feeding him\ncorrectly.
